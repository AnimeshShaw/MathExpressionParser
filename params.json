{"name":"MathExpressionParser","tagline":"Parser and evaluator for mathematical expressions","body":"Description :\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThis parser is a simple math expression parser that\r\nparses and evaluates various mathematical functions.\r\n\r\nTriginometric functions : sin, cos, tan, arctan, arccos,arcsin, sec, cosec,cot \r\n\r\nLogarithms : ln is used for natural log, log10 is log base 10 and log2 is log base 2\r\n\r\nOther functions : exp for exponentiation, abs for absolute value, sqrt for square root\r\n\r\nNumbers like 45.3e-13 are also supported \r\n\r\nThis parser can also take functions of one variable like\r\na math relation log10(x*sin(30*x)) with a variable x. Whenever such\r\nexpressions are encountered you are asked to enter the value of x.\r\n\r\nPlease Note :\r\n-------------------- \r\n\r\n1. Trigonometric functions work with radians and not degrees\r\n2. sin x is not valid but sin(x) or sin (x) is valid. Similarly its true for others too\r\n3. This parser also skips whitespaces and so it will work as long as parentheisation is in correct order\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nType help, description, usage for assistence and exit to leave.\r\n\r\nUsage :Type any mathematical expression with the functions stated above in the description\r\nexample : sin(2*x)*cos(x)\r\n","google":"UA-31260396-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
